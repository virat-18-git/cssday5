      Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is
      an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and ODI cricket for the
      Indian national team. A former captain in all formats of the game, Kohli
      retired from the T20I format following India's win at the 2024 T20 World
      Cup. He's a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm
      quick bowler. Kohli holds the highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks second
      in T20I, third in ODI, and stands the fourth-highest in international
      cricket.[4] Regarded as one of the greatest batsman of all time, he also
      holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and is
      second in the list of most international centuries scored in international
      cricket.[5]
